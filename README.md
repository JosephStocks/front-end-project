# Front End Project

Our project is a visual representation of US Census API data on a MapBox visual API.
The final product allows users to interactively hover/click on different areas of Houston and obtain certain Census data from those areas.
We wanted to offer the ability to easily derive characterizing information of micro-areas within the two loops of the Houston.

We implemented code primarily with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, Media Queries, and SASS (a CSS proprocessor).

Features incude: Navigation toggle, district toggle, zoom capability, hover/click information view.

@@@Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out 
how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example.
Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

@@@Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

  Joe Stocks: Leader of the group that converted most of our ideas into workable, understandable code, and handled the majority of the MapBox API implementation.
  Layne Mag: Handled the majority of the navigation toggle implementation, worked with Matthew to comb for the necessary Census information/implementation, and
             handled most styling.
  Matthew Chun: Worked on Census data implementation with Joe and Layne, aided Joe in creating a working interactive Census table, and worked with Layne in
             adding toggle functionality between micro-data areas and school districts.
